# TeacherDiary

Praca zaliczeniowa kursu C# "Wyzwanie 21 dni".

Description:
This is my first C# project for Certificate of finish the Basic Course by Adam Kamizelich.
The main idea of this project is to build electronic diary for teachers. Teacher can add student's (or pupil's) grades and program will write them to the different files. Every file name is unique and create from student's name and surname. Grades can be added in a few ways:

1. as a decimal number (range from 1 do 6), ex.: 2.5, 3.74, 4.44444445, etc.
2. as a intiger number with "+" and "-" signs (range also from 1 do 6), ex.: 3+, +3, -3, 3-.
3. in an American way, as a letters from A = best of the best, to F = failure.

Program validate all thoses grades and after changing them on corresponding decimal numbers, write them to the file. Any time you can add more grades to the file or calculate the final student's trimestr or end of the class grade.
